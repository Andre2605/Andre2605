# About Me.

# Hi Everyone! 

**A skillful data analyst and a machine learning enthusiast.**

Currently studying in **Applied Mathematics** at Universitas Prasetiya Mulya. Simultaneously, I am also participating in the Bangkit program on the Machine Learning path. I used to work as an intern in **Business Development** at PT FIF. Over a six months period, I did market research and processed data to see the development of product sales on a daily basis.

In 2020, I also had an internship for one month as a **Credit Analyst** at PT Akseleran Indonesia. I once helped collect and analyze all client financial data to find potential customers. In addition, I am also actively participating in student organizations, which are organized by the campus, to expand connections, communication skills and leadership. In campus organizations, I once helped by becoming a Liaison Officer. I have also helped organize events in the organization as event management, and have also been a social media manager.

I love to learn new things and I am constantly learning to develop my knowledge between the fields of data analysis, software engineering and machine learning.
